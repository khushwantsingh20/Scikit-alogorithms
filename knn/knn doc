### **What is KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)?**
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **classification and regression** tasks. It works on the principle of proximity‚Äî**data points that are close to each other are likely to have similar properties**.

KNN is a **lazy learning algorithm**, meaning it does not build a model during training but stores the dataset and makes predictions only when needed.

### **Where is KNN Used?**
KNN is widely used in various domains, including:
- **Image Recognition** ‚Äì Classifying images based on pixel similarities.
- **Recommendation Systems** ‚Äì Suggesting products based on similar user behavior.
- **Medical Diagnosis** ‚Äì Identifying diseases based on patient symptoms.
- **Anomaly Detection** ‚Äì Detecting fraud in financial transactions.
- **Text Categorization** ‚Äì Classifying documents or emails as spam or non-spam.

### **How Does KNN Work?**
1. **Choose K (Number of Neighbors)**  
   - The value of K determines how many neighbors influence the prediction.  
   - A small **K (e.g., K=3)** captures noise but fits well to local patterns.  
   - A large **K (e.g., K=10)** provides a more generalized decision.

2. **Calculate Distance**  
   - For each new data point, KNN finds the K nearest points from the dataset.
   - Common distance metrics:
     - **Euclidean Distance** (most used)
     - Manhattan Distance
     - Minkowski Distance

3. **Voting (For Classification)**  
   - The new data point is assigned to the **most common class** among the K neighbors.

4. **Averaging (For Regression)**  
   - The predicted value is the **average of the K nearest neighbors' values**.

### **How to Use KNN in Python?**
#### **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

#### **Step 2: Load and Prepare Data**
```python
# Example: Using the famous Iris dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

#### **Step 3: Feature Scaling (Recommended)**
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

#### **Step 4: Train KNN Model**
```python
# Define KNN classifier with K=5
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### **Step 5: Make Predictions**
```python
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
```

#### **Step 6: Evaluate Model Performance**
```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```

### **Choosing the Best K Value**
To find the optimal K, you can use the **elbow method**:
```python
error_rate = []
for i in range(1, 20):
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=i)
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
    pred_i = knn.predict(X_test)
    error_rate.append(np.mean(pred_i != y_test))

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(range(1, 20), error_rate, marker='o', linestyle='dashed')
plt.xlabel('K Value')
plt.ylabel('Error Rate')
plt.title('Choosing the Best K')
plt.show()
```
- The best K is where the error rate is the lowest (elbow point).

### **Pros and Cons of KNN**
#### **Pros**
‚úÖ **Simple and easy to implement**  
‚úÖ **Non-parametric (makes no assumptions about data distribution)**  
‚úÖ **Works well with small datasets**  

#### **Cons**
‚ùå **Computationally expensive for large datasets**  
‚ùå **Sensitive to irrelevant features and noise**  
‚ùå **Needs proper scaling of data for best performance**  

---

### **Conclusion**
- KNN is an intuitive, easy-to-use algorithm for both classification and regression.
- It works well for small datasets but struggles with large-scale data due to high computation costs.
- **Feature scaling and optimal K selection are critical for best performance.**
